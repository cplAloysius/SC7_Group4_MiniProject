# Fake News Detection
## About
This is our mini-project for SC1015 Introduction to Data Science and Aritificial Intelligence. Our project is on fake news detection where we attempt to identify features of fake news that differ from factual news.

## Problem Definition
- Can fake news be detected based on specific features that identify them as fake?
- Which model should we use to detect this?
## Model Used
K Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
## Conclusion
- Assumptions were made for how certain factors corelated with news being fake
- Exploratory data analysis was used to confirm these assumptions
- Features that contribute to a news being fake were identified
- KNN classifier supports these claims
